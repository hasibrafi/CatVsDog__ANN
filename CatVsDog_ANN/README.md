# Artificial-Neural-Networks:
Artificial neural networks are one of the main tools used in machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are the pieces of a computing system designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes information. They are the foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and solve problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards. ANN have self-learning capabilities that enable them to produce better results as more data become available.

- loc gets rows (or columns) with particular labels from the index.
- iloc gets rows (or columns) at particular positions in the index (so it only takes integers).

- Dendrites are receiver of the signal axon the neuron and axon is the transmit of the signal for the neuron.
- Axon doesn't touch the Dendrites.

## Activation Function :
- Sigmoid Function 
- Threshold Function 
- Rectifier Function
- Hyperbolic Tangent Function

## Cost Function :
- Cost function Calculate the output & Actual Value diffirence. 
- C = 1/2(Actual Value - OutPut Value)^2 .
- Need to be cost function to be very minimum or zero.

## Backpropagation :
- Its means adjust the Weight(W) simultiniously.

## Add Hidden Layer :
- classifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 6, init = 'uniform', activation = 'relu', input_dim = 11))..
- output_dim = Simply the number of nodes you want to add this hidden layer or (input +output) / 2 or Parameter tuning.
